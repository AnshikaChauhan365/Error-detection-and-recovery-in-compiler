# Error Detection and Recovery in Compiler

## Description
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement mechanisms that enable a compiler to detect and recover from errors efficiently during program translation. This project focuses on the essential aspects of compiler design—error detection and error recovery—ensuring that code compilation is more robust and user-friendly.

## Features
- **Error Detection:** Identifies various types of syntax and semantic errors in the source code.
- **Error Reporting:** Displays clear and informative error messages to the user.
- **Error Recovery:** Allows the compilation process to continue after encountering errors, so multiple errors can be reported in a single run.
- **Modular Design:** Code is organized into modules for easier maintenance and testing.
- **Python Implementation:** The entire project is developed in Python.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnshikaChauhan365/Error-detection-and-recovery-in-compiler.git
    cd Error-detection-and-recovery-in-compiler
    ```
2. (If required) Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your source code file.
2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3. Follow the instructions to provide input and observe error detection and recovery in action.
